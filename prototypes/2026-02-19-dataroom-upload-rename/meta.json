    { "file": "concept-v1.html", "notes": "All 5 phases in single file with phase navigator. Interactive rename editing, folder picker, summary expand. 3 demo files: 2 with messy names (get rename suggestions), 1 already clean (no rename row)." },
    { "file": "autoplay-v1.html", "notes": "POC: Self-running animated demo. Crossfade phase transitions (450ms cubic-bezier), staggered element reveals, animated progress bars with step indicators, looping playback with play/pause/restart controls. Phase timing: Source 2.5s, Select 2.2s, Processing 4s, Suggestions 3.8s, Success 3s. For FND-1421." },
    { "file": "autoplay-v2.html", "notes": "Full /animate skill output. Fixes v1 loop-replay bug (CSS animation-delays only fire once). JS-controlled stagger system with data-stagger-group/data-reveal-group attributes. requestAnimationFrame for smooth progress bars. 4-tier speed hierarchy: FAST 180-220ms (header/footer), MEDIUM 450-600ms (body crossfade), SLOW 700ms (height), SPRING 1100-1350ms (interactions). Icon wiggle pattern (from SuggestionPill): buttons use subtle scale(±3%) + icon rotate(±14deg), drop zones use border/bg pulse + icon rotate(±10deg) with translateY lift. Powers of 10 directional journey: fade→rise→dive→slide-right→scale-up per-phase entry origins with matching stagger directions. Self-drawing checkmarks with staged timing (rows first, then checks draw). Phase enter callbacks trigger stagger sequences. Total loop ~17.5s. Embed mode via ?embed." },
    { "file": "autoplay-v3.html", "notes": "Enhanced animation version for side-by-side comparison with v2. Three new techniques from industry research: (1) Self-drawing SVG checkmarks — stroke-dashoffset animation draws check marks in Phase 4 success indicators, staged after row stagger. (2) Filename typewriter — character-by-character reveal with blinking cursor for renamed filenames in Phase 3 suggestions. (3) Progress step connectors — thin lines between processing steps that fill left-to-right as each step completes in Phase 2. Adjusted dwell: suggestions 4000→4500ms, success 3000→3200ms. All other v2 features preserved." },

Focus-pull entrances, clip-path wipes. Typewriter filenames, self-drawing checkmarks, rAF progress with connecting dots. Refinements: dot-pop on step completion, shimmer sweep on processing cards, CTA glow on Done button, card send-off fly-away before loop restart. Total loop ~21s. Embed mode via ?embed." },
